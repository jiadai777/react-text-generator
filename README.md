This project is deployed on https://compassionate-ride-5279d2.netlify.com/

This app uses API from hipsterjesus.com. As of 10/18/2019, the API has a problem, which does not return the correct text data based on the paras and html parameter.

You can generate random texts and choose how many paragraphs you want and whether the texts should be in html format.

This simple React app demonstrate some basic understanding and implementation of React components.
